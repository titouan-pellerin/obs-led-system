# obs-led-system

Small system lighting LEDs connected to an Arduino Uno when changing a scene on the OBS streaming software.

The idea behind it was to have an indicator for the cameraman to know when his camera was live. When the scene changes, the LED corresponding to the camera of the scene is lit.

I built this for [Visufo](https://visufo.fr/) when we streamed a live concert on YouTube.

Here's the replay of this concert : https://youtu.be/TB8ZoHIQbyc
